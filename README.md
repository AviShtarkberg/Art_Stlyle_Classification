## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** WikiArt dataset (~80,000 paintings)
- **Genres Classified:** 13 (after preprocessing)
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Classes with fewer than **2,000 images were removed**.
  - **Data augmentation** (flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments) applied to underrepresented classes.
  - **Classes with >5,000 images were downsampled** to balance the dataset.
  - Images resized to **256√ó256 pixels** for consistency.
