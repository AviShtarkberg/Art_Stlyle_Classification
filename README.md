# üé® Art Style Classification

This repository contains code and models for classifying paintings into their respective genres using deep learning. The project utilizes the **WikiArt dataset**, which consists of approximately **80,000 paintings** across **27 different art genres**.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can **automatically classify paintings** based on their artistic style. The models explore **various architectures**, ranging from simple **softmax classifiers** to **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and **pre-trained models like ResNet and EfficientNet**.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** WikiArt dataset (~80,000 paintings)
- **Genres Classified:** 13 (after preprocessing)
- **Features Considered:**
  - Colors and shades
  - Painting tools and techniques
  - Overall composition
  - Artist and objects depicted
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Classes with fewer than **2,000 images were removed**.
  - **Data augmentation** (flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments) applied to underrepresented classes.
  - **Classes with >5,000 images were downsampled** to balance the dataset.
  - Images resized to **256√ó256 pixels** for consistency.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architectures
1. **Baseline Model:** Predicts the majority class, achieving ~7% accuracy.
2. **SoftMax Regression Model:** A simple linear model to classify paintings.
3. **Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN):** Multi-layer perceptron with different depths.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Standard CNN architectures with increasing complexity.
5. **Pre-trained Models:**
   - **ResNet18 & ResNet50:** Feature extraction using pre-trained ResNet models.
   - **EfficientNet-B0:** Feature extraction for efficient classification.
6. **Hypernetwork Model:** A novel architecture using a learnable latent vector to generate weights dynamically.

## üîç Key Findings
- **CNNs significantly outperformed fully connected networks** due to their ability to capture spatial features.
- **Pre-trained models like ResNet** improved classification accuracy, demonstrating the power of transfer learning.
- **Hypernetwork models** introduced an interesting approach but did not surpass the fine-tuned ResNet50 model.
- **Five-class classification performed better** than full multi-class classification due to reduced complexity.
